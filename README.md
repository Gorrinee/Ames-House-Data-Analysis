## General info
The project on house sale price in Ames included several steps and mainly focused on the topics that were covered in multivariate statistics class. 
First of all, we analyzed the data given, to indicate any outliers, to spot any particular correlation, and check assumptions for the linear regression model. Secondly, we plotted the best fit line to look at the significance of each numerical variable related to size, as size factors appear to be dominating in affecting the sale price. Thirdly, we looked at how significant is each categorical feature after adjusting for the size effect. Then, we saw if there was any statistically significant difference across neighborhoods, as it would help us answer our main research question: which neighborhoods are overpriced or underpriced. We also conducted a clustering analysis to see what are the main factors for houses groups. In the end, we concluded which particular neighborhoods had higher or lower prices than expected.
